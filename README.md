### 👨‍🔬 About Me
- Robotics engineer focused on autonomy, perception, and decision-making for field robots.
- Exploring resilient UAV systems that combine SLAM, reinforcement learning, and human-aware planning.
- Sharing open-source tooling, reproducible experiments, and research companions from my doctoral work.

### 🧭 What I'm Focused On Right Now
- Building real-world UAV navigation stacks that bridge simulation-to-flight gaps.
- Designing reinforcement learning policies that stay reliable under uncertainty.
- Contributing to collaborative robotics initiatives and student mentorship.

### 🔬 Research Spotlight
| Project | Objective | Current focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **mono_hydra** | Real-time monocular spatial perception system that fuses a camera and IMU to build 3D scene graphs with sub-20 cm error at 15 fps on laptop GPUs. | Extending from indoor pilots to outdoor scenarios, tightening the SLAM-to-scene-graph loop, and packaging a reproducible release for the robotics community. |
| **M2H (Multi-tasking Network)** | Lightweight ViT (DINOv2) multi-task framework predicting semantics, depth, edges, and normals via window-based cross-task attention. | Optimising edge deployments, broadening benchmarks (NYUDv2, Hypersim, Cityscapes), and serving as the perception backbone for mono_hydra. |

- **mono_hydra** pushes monocular SLAM beyond geometry by layering semantic understanding, enabling agile autonomy from simple sensor rigs.
- **M2H** delivers consistent cross-task predictions while staying real-time, outperforming single-task baselines and previous multi-task models across standard datasets.

### 📂 Repository Overview
| Theme | What you'll find | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
