### 👨‍🔬 About Me
- Robotics researcher advancing monocular spatial perception, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning for resilient autonomy.
- Building autonomy stacks that rely on lightweight sensor suites—RGB cameras and IMUs—without sacrificing robustness or reliability.
- Sharing open-source tooling, reproducible experiments, and research companions from my doctoral work.

### 🧭 What I'm Focused On Right Now
- Deploying monocular spatial systems like `mono_hydra` and `M2H` from lab conditions to real-world environments.
- Designing deep reinforcement learning policies that stay reliable under uncertainty and limited sensing.
- Contributing to collaborative robotics initiatives and student mentorship.

### 🔬 Research Spotlight
| Project | Objective | Current focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **mono_hydra** | Real-time monocular spatial perception system that fuses a camera and IMU to build 3D scene graphs with sub-20 cm error at 15 fps on laptop GPUs. | Extending from indoor pilots to outdoor scenarios, tightening the SLAM-to-scene-graph loop, and packaging a reproducible release for the robotics community. |
| **M2H (Multi-tasking Network)** | Lightweight ViT (DINOv2) multi-task framework predicting semantics, depth, edges, and normals via window-based cross-task attention. | Optimising edge deployments, broadening benchmarks (NYUDv2, Hypersim, Cityscapes), and serving as the perception backbone for mono_hydra. |

- **mono_hydra** pushes monocular SLAM beyond geometry by layering semantic understanding, enabling agile autonomy from simple sensor rigs.
- **M2H** delivers consistent cross-task predictions while staying real-time, outperforming single-task baselines and previous multi-task models across standard datasets.

### 🧠 Technical Interests
- Deep learning for spatial perception, multi-modal fusion, and cross-task representation learning.
- Deep reinforcement learning that keeps autonomous robots reliable in uncertain, dynamic environments.
- Monocular spatial systems like `mono_hydra` and `M2H` that turn research breakthroughs into deployable autonomy stacks.
